## About the Video Course
Have you heard of Apache Flink, but don't know how to use it to get on top of big data? Have you used Flink, but want to learn how to set it up and use it properly? Either way, this course is for you.
This course first introduces Flink concepts and terminology, and then moves on to building a Flink instance, collecting data, and using that data to generate output that can be used as processed data input into other systems. You will also use the Flink APIs to process data in batch and streaming modes.
By the end of the course, you will be capable of using the Apache Flink ecosystem to achieve complex tasks such as event processing and machine learning.
